Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
     Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software. 
     RELIABILITY:  It ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare,finance  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
     Mastering complexity- Is a significant stage where developers and teams actively focus on developing strategies and practices to effectively manage and mitigate the increasing 
                           complexity of software systems as they grow
     Mastering process- A stage where the industry focused on developing and refining structured methodologies and formal process to manage software development
     Mastering machine- A significant software development tool or process that allows for the final polish and customization of a software project.
     
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    planning- identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
    design-this is building the framework
    testing-examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    WATERFALL METHODOLOGY- Linear and sequential each phase is completed before moving on ___there is low flexibility, changes are hard eto incorporate once a phase is complete.
    AGILE METHODOLOGY- Iterative and icremental with multiple sprints___regular customer feedback is incorporated in every sprint

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic or by using different font colours.
         Debugging IDE enables a step through the code line by line as it runs and inspect code behaviour
    A VCS helps in collaboration- it enables multiple developers to work on the same code base without conflicts.
         
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
     Software Security- Research ways to be defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third party threats.
     Software accessibility and usability- Use scalable architecture, emphasize reliability
     
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
      System testing: Focuses on the entire software system as a whole including all functionalities and interactions.
           IMPORTANCE; It helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements including performance, usability and security.
      Intergration tests: Verify that different modules or services uesd by your application work well together
           IMPORTANCE; Helps to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected
           
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
      Prompt engineering is the porocess where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
           IMPORTANCE: Increased flexibilty- A prompt engineer can create prompt with dormain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
           

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
       Creative writting- write a short story about a robot who falls in love with a human
             IMPORTANCE; Well- crafted prompts lead to more accurate, relevant and useful responses from the AI model.
